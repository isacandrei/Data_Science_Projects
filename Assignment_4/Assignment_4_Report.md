1. Beethoven and The Killers
----------------------------
For this assignment, we have decided the choose to use last.fm data set. It is good to note that we initially tried using MatLab with this data set, but sadly MatLab isn't able to handle big data. Therefore, for this exercise, we have decided to use R which performed much better with this large dataset with reasonable computational time.

[*last.fm R Script*](R/Assign4.R)

**1)** To clean the data set, we removed all rows that contains only 1 play for an artist, taking into consideration that a user may mistakenly played a song or was just browsing through the library. Also, when reading the data set into our environment, R misreads certain characters in the data set, which we have replaced most of them to the correct ASCII characters. We also realised that there are a few URL's in the artist name column, therefore these were also removed.
